# Music-Box

Developed as my IFB102 Module 3 assignment where with using a Raspberry Pi, I had to develop an "IT System" with a legitimate usage. The solution had to have both software and hardware components but only had to be simple. "Music Box" utilised the RaspberyPI GPIO pins with a series of push buttons and a breadboard and was implemented in python using the "pygame" library. The solution is an in key keyboard with a toggleable key feature that upon pressing the buttons played in key .wav files.

The rationale of the solution's usfulness is that it allowed those without theoretical knowledge of music to play simple theoretically justified melodies and chords.
